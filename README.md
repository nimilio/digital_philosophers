My initial idea derives from the ancient Greek world and more specifically around the 5th â€“ 7th century BC, a period when the Pre-Socratic philosophers came to the scene. I retrieve a table from a web site containing all ancient Greek philosophers and from this table I keep only those philosophers I want, according to their schools. Then, I create a csv file to generate a visualization projecting schools and philosophers. From specific pdf files, I retrieve the content, which is fragments from six Pre-Socratic philosophers, and search for most frequent words. Finally, I create a word cloud using the frequent words from all pdfs and a collage containing pictures of those philosophers to whom the fragments belonged.
